class PopularityRecommender(BaseRecommender):
    """
    A customizable popularity recommendation system.

    With the popularity recommender system, users are presented items that are
    popular in the system. The popularity of an item is measured by the number
    of times users interacted with that item in the past. In this
    implementation, items do not expire and, therefore, the system does not base
    its choice on how recent the items are.

    Item attributes are represented by a `1x|I|` array, where `|I|` is the
    number of items in the system. This array stores the number of user
    interactions for each item.

    User profiles are represented by a `|U|x1` matrix, where `|U|` is the number
    of users in the system. All elements of this matrix are equal to 1, as the
    predictions of the system are solely based on the item attributes.

    Parameters
    -----------

        num_users: int (optional, default: 100)
            The number of users `|U|` in the system.

        num_items: int (optional, default: 1250)
            The number of items `|I|` in the system.

        item_representation: :obj:`numpy.ndarray` or None (optional, default: None)
            A `|A|x|I|` matrix representing the similarity between each item
            and attribute. If this is not None, num_items is ignored.

        user_representation: :obj:`numpy.ndarray` or None (optional, default: None)
            A `|U|x|A|` matrix representing the similarity between each item
            and attribute, as interpreted by the system. If this is not None, num_users is ignored.

        actual_user_representation: :obj:`numpy.ndarray` or None or \
                            :class:`~components.users.Users` (optional, default: None)
            Either a `|U|x|T|` matrix representing the real user profiles, where
            `T` is the number of attributes in the real underlying user profile,
            or a `Users` object that contains the real user profiles or real
            user-item scores. This matrix is **not** used for recommendations. This
            is only kept for measurements and the system is unaware of it.

        actual_item_representation: :obj:`numpy.ndarray` or None (optional, default: None)
            A `|T|x|I|` matrix representing the real user profiles, where
            `T` is the number of attributes in the real underlying item profile.
            This matrix is **not** used for recommendations. This
            is only kept for measurements and the system is unaware of it.

        verbose: bool (optional, default: False)
            If True, enables verbose mode. Disabled by default.

        num_items_per_iter: int (optional, default: 10)
            Number of items presented to the user per iteration.

        seed: int, None (optional, default: None)
            Seed for random generator.

    Attributes
    -----------
        Inherited by BaseRecommender: :class:`~models.recommender.BaseRecommender`

    Examples
    ---------
        PopularityRecommender can be instantiated with no arguments -- in which
        case, it will be initialized with the default parameters.

        >>> pr = PopularityRecommender()
        >>> pr.users_hat.shape
        (100, 1)   # <-- 100 users (default)
        >>> pr.items.shape
        (1, 1250) # <-- 1250 items (default)

        This class can be customized by defining the number of users and/or items
        in the system.

        >>> pr = PopularityRecommender(num_users=1200, num_items=5000)
        >>> pr.users_hat.shape
        (1200, 1) # <-- 1200 users
        >>> cf.items.shape
        (1, 5000)

        Or by generating representations for items (user representation can
        also be defined, but they should always be set to all ones). In the
        example below, items are uniformly distributed and have had between 0
        and 10 interactions each.

            >>> item_representation = np.random.randint(11, size=(1, 200))
            >>> pr = PopularityRecommender(item_representation=item_representation)
            >>> cf.items.shape
            (1, 200)
            >>> cf.users_hat.shape
            (100, 1)

        Note that all arguments passed in at initialization must be consistent -
        otherwise, an error is thrown. For example, one cannot pass in
        `num_users=200` but have `user_representation.shape` be `(300, 1)`.
        Likewise, one cannot pass in `num_items=1000` but have
        `item_representation.shape` be `(1, 500)`.
