It introduces the simplest ways to get started with the simulator, and it dives into more advanced concepts that will allow you to get a sense of the flexibility of the system. At the end of this guide, you should be able to configure the pre-loaded simulations with custom parameters and metrics."

    "## Main components\n",
    "A simulation needs the following components:\n",
    "(Add figure of overview.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Users**: agents who interact with each other and with items.\n",
    "- **Model**: agent that defines the behavior of the sociotechnical system. The model mediates the interactions among users and between users and the system.\n",
    "- **Items**: passive components that are served to the users by the model.\n",
    "- **Measurements**: modules built into the models which automatically compute information about the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dynamics\n",
    "The following steps are at the heart of the simulations:\n",
    "1. The **model** presents the **users** with some recommended **items**. In general, the items are chosen such that they maximize the probability of user engangement. This probability is based on the model's _prediction_ of user preferences.\n",
    "2. The **users** view the items presented by the **model**, and interact with some **items** according to some _actual_ preferences.\n",
    "3. The **model** updates its system state (such as the prediction of user preferences) based on the interactions of **users** with **items**, and it takes some **measurements**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see that this framework is very flexible and it can be a generalization of many classic and new models."
